        <h2 class="heading secondary">About Me</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Passionate about programming throughout my entire conscious life.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Like many others, I was first introduced to programming through BASIC in school computer science classes. At university, I gained my first experience with serious programming via Turbo Pascal and Delphi. Discovering C and C++ became a turning point, after which software development became my lifelong focus.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Started my professional career in software development, I worked on desktop applications (console-based and GUI) using C, C++, and Delphi for scientific, engineering, and industrial purposes, such as physical and mathematical modeling, data processing and visualization, and various computational tasks. I also developed computational and graphical programs using MatLab and Maple.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Accidentally discovered front-end development in 2010, I've become deeply interested in it, as I see this field as being at the intersection of mathematics and painting. Since then, I have been working professionally as a front-end developer for many years, accumulating best practices and continuously exploring new technologies.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I am a JavaScript fan with 15 years of experience, as well as 15 years of experience with core front-end technologies such as HTML and CSS. I have over 6 years of experience with React and have delivered more than 10 projects using React and its ecosystem, including building applications from scratch through production and maintaining existing projects.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">After reaching a senior level in front-end development, I expanded into back-end development and contributed to server-side functionality using Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, and PHP.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Throughout my career as a web developer, I have worked on a wide range of project categories, including SaaS platforms, corporate websites, internal software, fin-tech applications, media portals, e-commerce, CRMs, blogs, and personal websites.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">As a front-end developer, I enjoy creating interfaces that are pleasant to work with for both end users and developers.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I am interested in everything related to computer science and continuously learning new knowledge, technologies, and tools. Also my interests embrace physics, mathematics, music, and graphic design.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I believe that good algorithms will make the world better.</p>

            <a class="link" href="https://gitlab.com/ntlx-software/tonyxxx/-/tree/master" target="_blank">The craft project</a> - most interesting of my works.<br>
            Represents an operating system implemented on front-end. 
            See the sources in src/ directory.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Originated as an experimental project driven by a research interest in implementing an operating system based on the state machine concept and the reactive programming paradigm, while strictly adhering to a component-based approach and the layer segregation used in web dev: logic, presentation, data.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The system includes state dispatcher (acting as a kernel), file system, and GUI.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">The kernel transforms programmatic and user actions + current state data into input for the next state of components.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The file system is implemented as a tree-like structure with extended functionality, built around the philosophy that “everything is a data node”. A node can be associated with content of any type, will it be text, or remote resource, or another node.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The GUI is inspired by MS Windows and includes desktop, taskbar, navigator, and window system. It provides the following capabilities:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li class="list-item collection-item bullet">Displaying the file system structure in the navigator</li>
            <li class="list-item collection-item bullet">Displaying shortcuts to selected data nodes on the desktop</li>
            <li class="list-item collection-item bullet">Rendering data nodes within windows</li>
            <li class="list-item collection-item bullet">Opening windows via desktop shortcuts, in-window content shortcuts, navigation links, or API calls</li>
            <li class="list-item collection-item bullet">Equipping windows with functionality such as: open, close, focus, move, resize, switch to preset state (fullscreen, float, full-left, full-right, collapsed)</li>
            <li class="list-item collection-item bullet">Control window state via title bar controls, taskbar icons, and by snapping windows to screen edges (left, right, top, bottom)</li>
            <li class="list-item collection-item bullet">Moving windows by dragging the title bar</li>
            <li class="list-item collection-item bullet">Resizing windows by dragging window borders</li>
            <li class="list-item collection-item bullet">Maximizing/restoring windows via double-click on the title bar</li>
            <li class="list-item collection-item bullet">Collapsing/restoring all open windows via a taskbar action</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph">Display and behaviour parameters are fully configurable.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The project is under continuous development as time allow and new ideas income.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The practical example of the system in use is <a class="link" href="https://3r0k3z.github.io/tonyxxx-dist/" target="_blank">my online CV</a> that is completely implemented on this engine.</p>

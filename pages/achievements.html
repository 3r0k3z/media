        <p class="paragraph">Created a corporate front-end framework optimized for a specific domain. By working directly with Web APIs, it achieves up to x4 higher performance compared to existing frameworks, while maintaining minimal memory consumption and a compact bundle size. From a development perspective, it provides full control over functionality and enables process parallelization by leveraging a core concept of complete autonomy of the system’s logical units.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">1) Designed and implemented a module for handling domain-specific data, encompassing both server-side and client-side functionality. The module manages the retrieval, processing, transmission, and storage of dynamic hierarchical structures, and performs the following:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li class="list-item">&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;extracting flat data from a relational database;</li>
            <li class="list-item">&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;converting it into a hierarchical structure according to the relationship schema;</li>
            <li class="list-item">&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;processing the data programmatically in accordance with business logic;</li>
            <li class="list-item">&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;transforming it into a format suitable for the client side;</li>
            <li class="list-item">&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;sending the data to the client;</li>
            <li class="list-item">&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;rendering it on the client within a dynamic tree component, equipped with GUI functionality for editing, deleting, adding, and moving nodes;</li>
            <li class="list-item">&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;after modifications, sending a summary about changes to the server;</li>
            <li class="list-item">&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the server, converting the modifications into the format required by server-side logic with accordance to the info received, updating the database, and synchronizing related programmatical objects.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph">As part of this work, a custom data structure was invented and paired with an optimized algorithm that reduces traversal complexity from the estimated O(N + T + R) [where N is the number of data nodes, T is the number of tables, and R is the number of relationships defining the hierarchy] to O(N) that is significantly more economical, especially when data is retrieved portionally and T + R may exceed N.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">2) Successfully trained approximately 20 students in front-end, informatics fundamentals, and software development techniques.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">1) Created UI plugins that were then successfully reused across multiple products and by various developers:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">-&gt; A navigator for hierarchical structures of arbitrary depth, applicable as a main menu, context menu, or data tree visualization.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">-&gt; A fully customizable modal window, allowing its structure, content, configuration, and callbacks to be defined dynamically at any point in time.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">-&gt; A component for managing product-specific options, enabling visualization and configuration of data with complex logic and relational schemas.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">All listed plugins are fully configurable in terms of structure, behaviour, and presentation, and are equipped with APIs that allow full control over their state and actions - programmatically, via user interactions, or through the console.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">2) Developed a real-time multi-user access control system for interaction with concurrent areas of admin panel functionality.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">3) Reengineered the project codebase, evolving it into a modular and flexible system that easily allows modifications and adding new functionality.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">4) In terms of reengineering and optimization task, made UI fast, stable, and smooth, and lifted up the Web Vitals metrics from red/yellow to green according to Google indicators.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">1) Performed a reengineering of the state management system. By applying efficient algorithms and replacing copy-pasted logic with centralized, parameterized logic for homogeneous actions, the system became reusable and easy to modify, while the overall codebase size has been reduced multiple times.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">2) Refactored parts of the back-end implementations, resulting in a more compact codebase and increased reusability.</p>
